// Optimization-layer emission pins (src/Optimize.fs -- the semantic-
// equivalence layer). The corpus proves VALUES, and every pass in the layer
// is value-preserving by charter, so the corpus is structurally blind to a
// pass that silently stops firing (or fires where it must not). These pins
// read the emitted C++ instead -- the same rationale as FlatPathTests.
//
// Freeze-idiom recognition is the sharpest case: the recognized and
// unrecognized emissions produce byte-identical output at runtime, so ONLY
// an emission pin can distinguish "early exit derived" from "runs the whole
// budget". The contract half matters just as much in the other direction:
// the recognized idiom must NOT acquire the `while` spelling's BL8010
// budget abort (an optimization may change cost, never contract), and a
// guard that reads the step ordinal outside a lag-1 prefix read must
// DECLINE (not absorbing: such a guard can flip back true after a freeze).
//
// Pure lowering + codegen: no g++, no toolchain. Always runs.
